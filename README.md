## IF STATEMENTS

### What are if statements 

- Decision-making is required when we want to execute a code only if a certain condition is satisfied, the if/elif/else statement is used in Python for decision-making.
### These are the statements in action 
```python
age = 16
if age >= 15:  # If the the user is above the age of 15, allow them to buy a ticket
    print("Thank you, Please proceed to your purchase ")
elif age < 15:  # If the the user is not above the age of 15, do not allow them to buy a ticket
    print(" You may not pass")
else:  # anything else happens and no conditions are met, return this
    print("Something, went wrong, please try again later!")
```
